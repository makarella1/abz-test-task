<h2>Summary</h2>
<br>
Well, it was my first test task and I have to admit that I had tons of fun doing it. I initially thought the assignment was pretty easy but when I started bringing the desing to live I cooled down my enthusiasm a bit🙂 To be honest, I was writing CSS and HTML longer than I was writing React code, blame pixel-perfect layout for it🙃! In short, I learned a lot from this task and solidified the material I had learned recently greatly. <br><br>Yeah, maybe it took too long and sometimes I couldn't do very simple things, but that's all programming is about, isn't it? Try out everything you can till it works🙂 <br> I'm happy with the results especially since it was my first test assignment. <br><br> Really appreciate the guys from the abz.agency for the opportunity to try my hand at it🙏
